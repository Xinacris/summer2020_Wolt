I made a website for Wolt2020 Summer Internship pre-assigment project.

It loads JSON file from raw.githubusercontent. There is two buttons, one of them sorts the restaurants by name, other one filters avaible restaurants. Also there is a button for each restaurant which marks location of the restaurant.
